/**
 * FAKE SHIM — Greeter Agent (types only)
 * ======================================
 * The production greeter is a LiveKit *voice* agent; the WhatsApp agent
 * only imports the `CustomerContext` type from it (used by the carry-in
 * prompt addendum). Both type definitions below are VERBATIM from
 * pulpoo-final (`services/agents/inbound/greeter-agent.ts` and
 * `services/agents/inbound/active-orders.ts`); the voice runtime class is
 * intentionally absent.
